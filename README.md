# MySmallPortfolio
These are a few projects I worked on after AIV

----IMPORTANT----
I ALSO WORKED ON ANOTHER, MORE COMPLETE PROJECT DURING MY ITS COURSE, BUT I CURRENTLY CAN'T SEEM TO PUSH IT TO THIS REPO, PLEASE CONTACT ME FOR A DOWNLOAD LINK OF THE
.RAR FILE


The Pokèmon Simulator Project is a small Unity application to test myself to create recyclable code for any occasion, unfortunately I interrupted it when I got
selected to partecipate in an ITS Umbria course.

The project has a simple scene where 2 objects can be loaded on play mode, which will be 2 pokèmon, an EnemyPokèmon and a OwnPokèmon, all of their stats are loaded
from the corresponding ScriptableObjects, this allows easy-to-create assets and minimal effort to customize stats as well as the sprites used in the scene.

The HP bars get their max value on Awake, and they update at runtime, so, any change to the Pokèmon's HP, will immediatly be visible on screen.

The moves' buttons are set to appear only if they have a move in it, their color will be the corresponding type's color, the types that are currently available are Fire,
Grass and Water, the Pokèmon that are currently available are Blastoise and Venusaur.
